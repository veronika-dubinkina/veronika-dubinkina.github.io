Education
======
* Ph.D in Bioengineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2022
  * Advisor: [Prof. Sergei Maslov] (https://maslov.bioengineering.illinois.edu/)
  * Thesis title: Mechanistic modeling of complex microbial communities.

* M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, 2015
  * Advisors: Dr. Dmitry Alexeev, Dr. Alexander Tyakht
  * Thesis title: Development of a method to evaluate the diversity of metagenomes from the human intestinal microbiome on the basis of a k-mer approach. 

* B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, 2013
  * Advisor: [Prof. Roman Efremov] (https://model.nmr.ru/?page=about.cv.efremov-cv)
  * Thesis title: Computer modeling of structure and dynamics of lipid bilayer simulating bacterial membrane.  


Work experience
======
* 2022-present: Bioinformatics Fellow
  * Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, US
  * I work on development of bioinformatic pipelines for metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS). I also study eco-evolutionary forces that shape human gut microbiome via strain level analysis of taxonomic and functional structure of the community.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Pollard

* 2022-present: Research Affiliate
  * Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment, Urbana-Champaign, US
  * As a continuation of my work for CABBI, I perform bioinformatic analysis of multi-omics data for novel yeast species with an aim of discovering genes involved in low pH tolerance and antimicrobial drug resistance.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Maslov
  
Community service and outreach
======
* 2022: Workshop [“Modeling Microbial Ecology at Multiple Scales”](https://modelmems.github.io/),
tutorial on consumer-resource models 

* 2016: Workshop “NGS data analysis”,
tutorial on WGS metagenomic data analysis

* Since 2019 Mentoring students on “Science” career track through Phystech Union mentorship program

* Reviewed manuscripts for Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Bioinformatics, PLOS Computational Biology, Journal of Oral Microbiology, Physical Review E, Current Genetics, Nature Communications.
