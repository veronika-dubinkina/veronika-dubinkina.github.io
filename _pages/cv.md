Education
======
* B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, 2013
  * Advisor: Prof. Roman Efremov
  * Thesis title: Computer modeling of structure and dynamics of lipid bilayer simulating bacterial membrane.  
* M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, 2015
  * Advisors: Prof. Dmitry Alexeev, Dr. Alexander Tyakht
  * Thesis title: Development of a method to evaluate the diversity of metagenomes from the human intestinal microbiome on the basis of a k-mer approach. 
* Ph.D in Bioengineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2022
  * Advisor: Prof. Sergei Maslov
  * Thesis title: Mechanistic modeling of complex microbial communities.

Work experience
======
* 2022-present: Bioinformatics Fellow
  * Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, US
  * I work on development of bioinformatic pipelines for metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS). I also study eco-evolutionary forces that shape human gut microbiome via strain level analysis of taxonomic and functional structure of the community.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Pollard

* 2022-present: Research Affiliate
  * Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment, Urbana-Champaign, US
  * As a continuation of my work for CABBI, I perform bioinformatic analysis of multi-omics data for novel yeast species with an aim of discovering genes involved in low pH tolerance and antimicrobial drug resistance.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Maslov
